                style="float:right; margin:0px 15px">"The tangerine is a type of citrus fruit that is orange in color.
            Its scientific name varies. It has been treated as a separate species under the name Citrus tangerina or
            Citrus x tangerina, or treated as a variety of Citrus reticulata, the mandarin orange."</p>
        <p>"Tangerines are smaller and less rounded than the oranges. The taste is considered less sour, as well as
            sweeter and stronger, than that of an orange.[9] A ripe tangerine is firm to slightly soft, and
            pebbly-skinned with no deep grooves, as well as orange in color. "</p>
        <p>"Peak tangerine season lasts from autumn to spring. Tangerines are most commonly peeled and eaten by hand.
            The fresh fruit is also used in salads, desserts and main dishes."</p>
